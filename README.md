The new personal home page of Sean Kelly, independent consultant, amateur gastronome, former mixologist, potential podcaster (I'm fashionably late), and so forth.

I provide professional consulting services mainly in Python specializing in data science, big data, multimedia publishing, communications protocols, audio/video, and more. Where possible, I both leverage open source software and make my work available as open source software.

I'm a member of the Apache Software Foundation and former Vice President of the same.
